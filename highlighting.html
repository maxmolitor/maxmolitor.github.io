                The Effect of Highlighting on Multi-Perspective Art Learning

                This Project was my Bachelor's Thesis and encompassed the (further)-development of a digital learning environment for the
                Herzog Anton Ulrich-Museum, a art-historic museum in Braunschweig. Further, I conducted a learning-psychological experiment on the effect
                of the highlighting-extension of the learning environment on learners' learning success and behaviour with regard to their visuospatial ability.
                Results revealed highlighting to have supported low-visuospatial learners in attaining higher learning gains but limited high-visuospatial 
                learners who scored lower learning gains than the control group.
                It was theorized that highlighting assisted low-visuospatial learners in information selection and perspective processing, 
                by reducing visuospatial working-memory requirements but limited high- visuospatial learners to potentially attend to more artworks than suggested. 
                This study confirmed visuospatial ability as a predictor of learning gains in multi-perspective hypermedia learning environments (MHEs), 
                instructional theories of digital learning environments and set forth concrete visual design implications for MHEs.

                I was supervised by Prof. Dr. Enkelejda Kasneci from the HCI Research-Group at the University of TÃ¼bingen and Dr. Franz Wortha from the University of Greifswald.

                The App is shown below and it works on the Firefox and Safari Browsers.
                It includes the highlighting of artworks which are relevant to learning-guidance questions shown on the right panel.
