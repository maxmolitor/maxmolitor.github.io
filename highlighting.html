                This Project was my Bachelor's Thesis and encompassed the (further)-development of a digital learning environment for the
                Herzog Anton Ulrich-Museum, a art-historic museum in Braunschweig. Further, I conducted a learning-psychological experiment on the effect
                of the highlighting-extension of the learning environment on learners' learning success and behaviour with regard to their visuospatial ability.
                Results revealed highlighting to have supported low-visuospatial learners in attaining higher learning gains but limited high-visuospatial 
                learners who scored lower learning gains than the control group.
                It was theorized that highlighting assisted low-visuospatial learners in information selection and perspective processing, 
                by reducing visuospatial working-memory requirements but limited high- visuospatial learners to potentially attend to more artworks than suggested. 
                This study confirmed visuospatial ability as a predictor of learning gains in MHEs, 
                instructional theories of digital learning environments and set forth concrete visual design implications for MHEs.
