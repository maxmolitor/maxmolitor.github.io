                This photography-series was displayed at the yearly Rundgang-exhibition of the University of the Arts Berlin and dealt with the topic of dissociation between artificial representations and real objects.
                My analogue photographies captured flowers during night-time with artificial light. An image which is completely separated and dissociated
                from the actual natural object was produced which took on an abstract form resembling a painting, animation or a rendering.

                The Project was realised in the Photography Course (Summersemester 2023) of Sebastian Herold.
