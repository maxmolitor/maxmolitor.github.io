                This is a project I am currently working on. It started as my master's thesis at the study program Design & Computation at the University of Arts Berlin and the Technical University Berlin which I completed. 
                <br><br>
                It encompassed the development of a VR-environment which acts as a quasi-identical copy 
                of two real exhibition rooms of the Herzog-Anton-Ulrich Museum in Braunschweig. In the VR one can move around in a identically sized
                empty room, as well as use a VR-IPad which is equipped with an art-historic learning environment. The project also encompassed two learning- and art-psychological studies concerning the comparison between virtual and real exhibition rooms.
                The studies were completed and a publication is underway.
                <br><br>
                I was supervised by Prof. Dr. Susanne Hauser and Christian Schmidts of the University of the Arts, Berlin, as well as Dr. Jens Maiero and further members of the
                Multimodal Interaction Research Group at the Leibniz-Institute of Knowledge Media (IWM), Prof. Dr. Peter Gerjets, Dr. 
                Birgit Brucker and Laura Peiffer-Siebert. I also cooperated with Dr. Sven Nommensen of the Herzog-Anton-Ulrich Museum in Braunschweig, who was very hospitable in letting me conduct the study in their art-historic museum.
