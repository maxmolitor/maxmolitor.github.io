                This is a project I am currently working on. It encompasses the development of a VR-environment which acts as an identical copy 
                of two real exhibition rooms of the Herzog Anton Ulrich Museum in Braunschweig. In the VR one can move around in a identically sized
                empty room, as well as use a VR-IPad which is equipped with an art-historic learning environment. The project also encompasses the execution
                of two learning- and art-psychological studies on the comparison between virtual and real exhibition rooms concerning learning and art-experience.

                Abstract:
                <br>
                In light of the increasing usage of VR as extensions of museums, research gaps remain on how and if VR-versions of real exhibition environments 
                affect learning and art-experience differently. Moreover, given an effect of the museum-context on art-experience, their application in vs. outside 
                the museum must be considered. At the same time, research calls exist if photorealistic 360°-images, which can increase VRs immersivity, can ameliorate 
                their effectiveness as learning environments. Based on these three open research questions, a highly immersive and interactive VR was developed which 
                replicated two real exhibition rooms of the Herzog-Anton-Ulrich Museum, Brunswick, which contained different art-historic artworks paired with an Ipad 
                with an art-historic learning environment on the artworks. It was empirically tested against the real exhibition room, in a within-subject experimental design, 
                concerning participants' art-experience and learning. In a second study outside the museum, different participants analogously experienced both a 
                VR-replica with and without 360°-images in an identical within-subject study, to measure a potential positive effect of 360°-images on learning and art-experience. 
                Lastly, data from these two studies was used to identify if learning and experiencing art in the VR profited from physically being at the museum location. 
                Results revealed the VR-replica being able to provide unexpectedly similar learning and art-experience compared to the real exhibition room, underlining 
                its potential as a valid digital extension able to provide aesthetic and educational experiences comparable with the real exhibition room. 360°-images 
                had negative effects on learning but positive on presence. Their negative learning results were theorised to stem from higher cognitive load due to a 
                novelty-effect in the suboptimal use of the learning environment, which offered a more realistic and interesting museal experience but required cognitive 
                mastering for effective transfer to learning gain. Thirdly the VR appeared not to be affected by its’ physical context, i.e. if it was used in or outside the museum, 
                highlighting its potential as a digital extension of a physical museum able to provide similar learning and art-experiences as the real physical exhibition room.
