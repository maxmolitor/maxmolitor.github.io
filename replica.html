                This is a project I am currently working on. It encompasses the development of a VR-environment which acts as an identical copy 
                of two real exhibition rooms of the Herzog Anton Ulrich Museum in Braunschweig. In the VR one can move around in a identically sized
                empty room, as well as use a VR-IPad which is equipped with an art-historic learning environment. The project also encompasses the execution
                of two learning- and art-psychological studies on the comparison between virtual and real exhibition rooms concerning learning and art-experience.
