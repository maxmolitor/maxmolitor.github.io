                This is a project I am currently working on. It encompasses the development of a VR-environment which acts as a (nearly) identical copy 
                of two real exhibition rooms of the Herzog-Anton-Ulrich Museum in Braunschweig. In the VR one can move around in a identically sized
                empty room, as well as use a VR-IPad which is equipped with an art-historic learning environment. The project also encompasses the execution
                of two learning- and art-psychological studies on the comparison between virtual and real exhibition rooms concerning learning and art-experience.

                I am supervised by Prof. Dr. Susanne Hauser and Christian Schmidts of the University of the Arts, Berlin, as well as Dr. Jens Maiero from the 
                Leibniz-Institute of Knowledge Media (IWM), TÃ¼bingen. I further am cooperating with the Multimodal Interaction Research-Group (Prof. Dr. Peter Gerjets, Dr. 
                Birgit Brucker, Laura Peiffer-Siebert) at the IWM, as well as Dr. Sven Nommensen of the Herzog-Anton-Ulrich Museum in Braunschweig.
