                Dreaming & Digitality is a project composed of three distinct, but interconnected, parts or subprojects. 
                First, a short film titled ‘awake’ on the topic of doom scrolling, the bad habit of being trapped in an endless scrolling-activity on social-media, and how the visual experience resembles the experience of dreaming. Second, a short comic titled ‘somnio ergo sum’ which tells the story of a man dreaming of a relationship outside of his current failing one, who is in the end left with feeling real feelings from a dreamt relationship and the question how he should deal with them - the story is integrated as part of a written philosophical essay offering a solution on the question how to deal with ‘dream feelings’. Thirdly, the final exhibition which combines both part 1 and 2 into a presentable and communicable form, via a setup separating interior and exterior space with a veil, a movie setup with a magazine on background information concerning all the aspects of the projects and a reading nook on the outside in which viewers were able to read the comic and the thought experiment of part 2. Please see the group description for more details.

                How I integrated my personal views and positions

            <div class="textblock">
                During the project I took the role of a ‘project lead’, first proposing the project idea to Lilli Grube with whom I produced the film in the end, and reaching out to Su Durakbasa if she would like to cooperation concerning a visualisation of a philosophical thought experiment into the playful comic style of hers. Of Course we cooperated, communicated internally and see ourselves as a team, nevertheless we still worked on two distinct projects that fed into each other, distinct and at the same time interweaved. Lilli and I worked on the film awake, we thought of the concept, wrote the script, filmed the clips, cut the clips and worked with stable diffusion to merge the clips into each other. Su and I worked on the thought experiment, as well as the comic together, where we came together to discuss the concept behind the story, which laid the basis for the philosophical argumentation of the thought experiment.
                <br><br>
                For me personally, the project definitely was a way to combine theoretical standpoints in philosophy of mind, namely contemporary epistemology, with artistic expression, such as through the comic, the movie or the final exhibition construction. My personal position concerns the nature of the mind and stems a big part from my cognitive science background. I have extensively described this in my previous ‘studio abgabe’ but would like to summarise that I both argue for the existence of cognitive penetration concerning perception, that perception, i.e. purely what we see and hear and so on, is influenced by cognition, i.e. language, knowledge, emotion, etc. Further, I position my in a representational dualism position, that describes the existence of physical and mental things such as consciousness which cannot fully be explained by the physical, but are representational, i.e. they are based on real things in the real world, that they represent (Lyons, 2017), i.e. that our conscious content is not physical but is based on real things, in the way that they represent real things. I would extend this to the concept of qualia, the phenomenological content of consciousness, such as the conscious content of seeing the color red (Jackson, 1998), which exists on the mental side of things. Concerning the topic of dreams, it could mean that dreams are phenomenological by nature, that they are based on physical activity in the brain, but only visible to us the dreamer. 
                <br><br>
                I wanted to research, the contents of dreams not only in a philosophical way, such as in the Seminar ‘Introduction in die Philosophie des Geistes’ from Prof. Dr. Krickel at the TU Berlin which I attended during the semester, and which was a powerful theoretical contrast and support, but also in an artistic way in the project digitality and dreaming. In the short movie ‘awake’ I seeked an expression of my philosophical views into an artistic format on the screen and further in the final exhibition construction. Whereas in part 2 of the project, the comic ‘somnio ergo sum’ which was based, but at the same time, laid the basis for my philosophical thought experiment ‘How could I deal with dream feelings’ which communicates a philosophical argumentation I construct in a strictly scientific manner - but further is an expression of my personal doubts, views, and questions on the nature of the world. I aimed at being both scientific and artistic at the same time, with one project, part 1 being more on the artistic side, an experimental format of a looping film with ‘dreamy’ elements in stable diffusion, and part 2 being more on the scientific side, but working with artistic means of communication, the comic ‘somnio ergo sum’. My personal position concerning the nature of the mind, is expressed in the example of dreams in the project, in that I believe that dreams are real experiences, they are phenomenological in content, but also represented by real neurological activity in the brain. In part 2, I attempted to take the example of real feelings which are produced by dreams, to show how ‘non real’, non-material, phenomenological experiences that are only visible to us, can have a real influence on our interior world of emotions, and thus give weight to the phenomenology of dreams. Dreams are an example of purely mental, phenomenological content, being able to influence our real world, such as via thoughts and emotions that emerge after a dream.
                <br><br>
                On the other hand, the project also deals with the topic of digitality, and inhowfar digital worlds and dream worlds are similar, which is our RQ1. We explicitly delved into this topic in part 1 of our project, which is the short movie ‘awake’ and compares the visual experience of dreaming with the concept of doomscrolling (Searles & Feezell, 2023). In this case, I also deal with a personal position of mine concerning negative social media usage. The short film shows how doomscrolling can lead to a seclusion from society, the outside world, depression and the feeling of being stuck and it is definitely a personal artistic expression of mine concerning negative aspects of the spread of the digital world. With the WHO reporting high levels of mental illnesses in the worldwide population (13% of the global population living with mental illnesses) and with the COVID-19 pandemic making the situation more complex (WHO, 2022) the topic has become more relevant. The COVID-19 pandemic accelerated a digitzation of society, with the Digitalpakt I in Germany acting as a positive example of increased funding of digital tools in Germany for the sake of education (Scheiter & Lachner, 2019), but I wanted to look at the negative sides as well, from also a technological lens, via the artistic use of stable diffusion in part 1, ‘awake’, for example. Nevertheless, the Dreaming & Digitality also expresses positive aspects of dreaming in part 1 and thereby extrapolates to the digital world as it is its’ metaphor in this project. In part 1 dreaming is a way to escape daily life, and ones’ worry and make it possible to enter new worlds and experiences, perhaps digital worlds also can make it possible to explore new relationships, structures and societes. In sum, my personal position towards digital worlds is that they ambivalent in that they bring many advantages for society, such as increased interconnectedness, new cultural spaces, increased productivity, for example, but also negatives, such as social media addiction, social seclusion and questionable practices of large companies in the digital space.

                In further iterations, inside or outside of the project, it would be possible for me to increase my knowledge and skills of virtual spaces, specifically 360° images and VR-environments. We could, as we note in our group submission, extend the project to VR- and 360°. For example, in my Master’s thesis I plan to work with VR in order to replicate a Museum Room. Further, I, speaking for myself, would be very interested to continue to work with Su and Lilli as I thought it was a well balanced team. Perhaps in future iterations further projects will be possible.
